1. Use the data from the iod.csv file you analyzed in the previous homework to create
a model for GFR that considers nonlinear transformations (polynomials, step functions,
splines, generalized additive models) for continuous predictors. Try each type of nonlinear
function and give statistical support (e.g, by using a hypothesis test) to your final choice.
If the function is nonparametric or hard to interpret, try to represent it using a function
that can be interpreted straightforwardly.
You can either divide your data into a training set and a test set to validate or use crossvalidation.
If you are using cross-validation, you will need to automate your model fitting
process in order to be able to replicate it on the various folds.
As always, explain the methods you are using, provide useful tables and figures with accompanying
text and elucidate the implications and conclusions of your modeling process
